    <p>This was a pasta dish I found online when looking for a pasta recipe different from what I usually make.  This dish is easy to make, especially on a week night when you don't feel like cooking.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb cherry tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>1/4 cup plus 1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic minced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup torn fresh basil</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 lb angel hair pasta</li>
        <li>3/4 lb boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1/4 cup freshly grated parmesan</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
       <li>In a large bowl, stir together tomatoes, 1/4 cup olive oil, garlic and basil and season generously with salt and pepper. Let sit 15 minutes.</li>
       <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair until al dente, 4 minutes. Drain and return to pot.</li>
       <li>In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat remaining tablespoon olive oil. Add chicken and season with Italian seasoning salt, and pepper. Cook until no longer pink, 10 minutes per side. Let rest 5 minutes, then thinly slice.</li>
       <li>Add tomato mixture and sliced chicken to angel hair and toss until fully combined.</li>
       <li>Top with Parmesan and serve.</li>
    </ol>
